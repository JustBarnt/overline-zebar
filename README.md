## Installation

### Option 1: Download the Pre-built Release

This is the easiest and fastest way to get overline-zebar up and running. Choose this option if you want to use the widget with its default configuration.

*This uses Flow Launcher as the default launcher application. If you use a different launcher, you will need to build the widget from source.*

1. Go to the [Releases page](https://github.com/mushfikurr/overline-zebar/releases) on GitHub
2. Download the latest `overline-zebar.zip` file
3. Extract the zip file to your Zebar widget directory:
   ```
   C:\Users\<username>\.glzr\zebar\
   ```
   This should create a folder named `overline-zebar` in your Zebar widget directory.
4. Enable the widget by expanding the "Widget configs" option, selecting "overline-zebar > default", and clicking "Enable". You can also enable the widget to startup the same way.
5. Position the widget dimensions and position by right clicking the Zebar system tray icon and selecting "Open Settings".
6. Save your configuration by clicking "Save" in the Zebar settings window

### Option 2: Build from Source

Choose this option if you want to:

- Customize the widget's functionality beyond what's possible with the pre-built version
- Modify the source code to add new features or change existing ones
- Contribute to the development of overline-zebar
- Use the latest development version with unreleased features

Prerequisites:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or newer)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

Detailed steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/mushfikurr/overline-zebar.git
   cd overline-zebar
   ```

2. Install all required dependencies:

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

   This will install React, Vite, TailwindCSS, and all other dependencies needed for development.

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory to customize behavior (optional):

   ```sh
   # Path to your Flow Launcher executable (if you use Flow Launcher)
   VITE_FLOW_LAUNCHER_PATH=C:\Program Files\FlowLauncher\Flow.Launcher.exe

   # Enable or disable auto-tiling functionality
   VITE_USE_AUTOTILING=false

   # WebSocket URI for auto-tiling functionality
   VITE_AUTOTILING_WEBSOCKET_URI=ws://localhost:6123
   ```

   You can customize these values based on your specific setup and preferences.

4. Build the project for production:
   ```sh
   npm run build
   ```
   This creates a `dist` folder containing the compiled widget ready for use.

### Environment Variables (For Custom Builds Only)

These variables only apply if you're building the project yourself. They allow you to customize key aspects of the widget's functionality without modifying the source code directly.

- **`VITE_FLOW_LAUNCHER_PATH`**: Path to an `.exe` file executed when clicking the search icon

  - Default: `C:\Program Files\FlowLauncher\Flow.Launcher.exe`
  - Example custom value: `C:\Program Files\Launchers\MyCustomLauncher.exe`
  - Set this if you use a different launcher application or if Flow Launcher is installed in a non-standard location

- **`VITE_USE_AUTOTILING`**: Controls the auto-tiling functionality

  - Default: `false`
  - Set to `true` to enable automatic tiling direction switching
  - When enabled, new windows will automatically switch tiling directions based on the size of the focused window
  - This creates a more efficient use of screen space for different window sizes

- **`VITE_AUTOTILING_WEBSOCKET_URI`**: WebSocket URI for auto-tiling functionality
  - Default: `ws://localhost:6123`
  - Change this if you're running the WebSocket server on a different port or machine
  - Only relevant if `VITE_USE_AUTOTILING` is set to `true`

**Note:** All environment variables have sensible defaults, so the `.env` file is only needed if you want to override these defaults. If you don't create an `.env` file, the widget will use the default values.

## Customization

Customisation requires building the widget from source. If you're using the pre-built release, you can skip this section.

### Fonts

Fonts are defined in [`src/styles/fonts.css`](src/styles/fonts.css).

- Use system fonts directly.
- Or, download fonts to the `public/` folder and reference them in `fonts.css`.
- [Font reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font).

### Colors

- Edit [`tailwind.config.js`](tailwind.config.js) to customize colors.

---

## Development & Hot Reload

Follow the steps to build the project from source.

1. Start the build process (with hot reloading):
   ```sh
   npm run build:watch
   ```
2. Edit code â€” Zebar will automatically restart on save (if the widget is selected in Zebar).
3. Enable auto-save in your text editor for faster iteration.
