## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/mushfikurr/overline-zebar.git
```

### 2. Create a `.env` File

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and define the following variables:

```sh
VITE_FLOW_LAUNCHER_PATH=
VITE_USE_AUTOTILING=
```

- **`VITE_FLOW_LAUNCHER_PATH`**: Path to an `.exe` file executed when clicking the search icon (default is Flow Launcher, but any executable works).
- **`VITE_USE_AUTOTILING`**: Set to `true` or `false`.
  - If `true`, new windows will automatically switch tiling directions based on the size of the focused window.

## Customization

### Fonts

Fonts are defined in [`src/styles/fonts.css`](src/styles/fonts.css).

- Use system fonts directly.
- Or, download fonts to the `public/` folder and reference them in `fonts.css`.
- [Font reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font).

### Colors

- Edit [`tailwind.config.js`](tailwind.config.js) to customize colors.

2. Edit code â€” Zebar will automatically restart on save (if the widget is selected in Zebar).
3. Enable auto-save in your text editor for faster iteration.
